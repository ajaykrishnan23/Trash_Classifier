# Trash_Classifier
Built on Pytorch through various other attempts at networks and finally landing at Transfer Learning, this "Hello World" Pytorch project lets you know whether an object is biodegradable or not and under what category it comes under out of 6 categories - Cardboard, Paper, Plastic, Metal, Gl(ass) and Trash. 


Let us know what kind of trash your face is! :DD
