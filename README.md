# Trash_Classifier
Built on Pytorch through various other attempts at deep neural networks, this Pytorch project lets you know whether an object is biodegradable or not and under what category it comes under out of 6 categories - Cardboard, Paper, Plastic, Metal, Glass and Trash. 

It also classifies whether that given object is biodegrable or non-biodegradable. Potential integrations with other ideas will be updated in the future. Till then, stay woke x)
###### Tested on real life objects and had a test accuracy of 88.8%
